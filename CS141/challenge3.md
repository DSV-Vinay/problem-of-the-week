# Problem: Convert a Nested List into a Flat List

**Problem Statement:**  
Write a program that takes a nested list as input and converts it into a flat list, meaning all the elements should be in a single list without any nesting.

## _Example:_
**Input**
```
[1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]], 7]
```

**Output**
```
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
```

# Hints
To check if an object is a list, you can use 
```
if type(obj) is list
```

Good Luck and Happy Coding
