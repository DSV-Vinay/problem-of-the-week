# Objective
Testing POTW website

## Checking Code Environment
```python
def fibon(n):
    if n == 1:
        return n
    return fibon(n-1) + fibon(n-2)
```

## Checking Inline Math

The Taylor series expansion of $$e^x$$  around $$ x = 0 $$ is given by:

$$ e^x = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{x^n}{n!} = 1 + \frac{x}{1!} + \frac{x^2}{2!} + \frac{x^3}{3!} + \cdots $$

This series provides an infinite sum that converges to $$ e^x $$ for all real numbers $$ x \in \mathbb{R} $$



Good luck and happy coding!
