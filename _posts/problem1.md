## Problem Statement

Write a function that takes a list of integers and returns the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

### Input

- A list of integers, `nums`.

### Output

- An integer representing the sum of all the even numbers in the list.

### Example

```python
def sum_of_evens(nums):
    # Your code here

# Example usage:
print(sum_of_evens([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Output: 12
print(sum_of_evens([10, 21, 32, 43, 54]))  # Output: 96
print(sum_of_evens([1, 3, 5, 7]))  # Output: 0
```

### Constraints

1. The list can contain up to 10^5 integers.
2. Each integer in the list is between -10^6 and 10^6.

Good luck and happy coding!
